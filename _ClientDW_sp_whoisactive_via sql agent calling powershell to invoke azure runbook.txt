--GoogleDrive\SQL Server\DBA-Scripts\PowerShell\Azure SQL DB  sp_whoisactive implementation

First create the following objects in the ClientDW (Azure SQL Database)
	1. dbo.WhoIsActive (table to store results of the stored procedure dbo.sp_whoisactive)
	2. ro.vw_WhoisActive (view for clients to access the data in dbo schema using the view in ro schema)
	3. dbo.sp_whoisactive (open source stored procedure)
	4. dbo.sp_whoisactive_populate (wrapper stored proc that calls the dbo.sp_whoisactive and populates dbo.WhoIsActive)
	5. dbo.sp_whoisactive_prune (stored procedure to delete any records older than 7 days from the table dbo.WhoIsActive)

webhook
https://s13events.azure-automation.net/webhooks?token=KgekiXSc%2bcgXpP6Dn%2fbmttaRISNc1djYLNZfGzi89DU%3d


1. Create a powershell runbook to execute the sp_whoisactive_populate and sp_whoisactive_prune store procs
	See the runbook named 'DBA_srv-bostonbruins-01_db-bostonbruins-prod_whoisactive'
2. Create a webhook for the runbook, no need to create a schedule since azure schedule does not have minute level scheduling
	webhook method is 'https' and action is 'post'
3. Create a sql agent job and schdule it to run every minute or whatever the required schedule is
	Reference job is named 'BostonBruins.ClientDW.WhoIsActive' on vm-etl-prod-01'
	Make sure to update the name of the powershell file and parameters to invoke the webhook.
4. In C:\Powershell folder make a copy of the powershell script named 'Bruins_ClientDW_WhoIsActive.ps1' for the client and point the job step 2 for the above job to that powershell script to be executed


PS.  We might need only one powershell script to be called for each job passing in the correct parametes for the webhook and method.
